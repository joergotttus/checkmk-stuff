Some CheckMK-Stuff from the field

Tested and running on CheckMK 2.2, also working with CheckMK 2.3.

Just some scripts that came in handy when needed - CheckMK is great, but lacking some details when it comes to monitoring Windows systems.
And of course, while working with CheckMK for more than two years now, I found out that also some linux-stuff is missing.

Mainly PowerShell as I personally consider PS the most powerful tool for Windows. Will maybe upload some scripts in VBS oder CMD, depending on my own needs and possibilites.
As I only have some basic linux skills the linux scripts are simply bash-scripts.

Feel free to use, fork, comment and make the whole thing run smooth and fast. ;-)
