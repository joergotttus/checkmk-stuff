Some CheckMK-Stuff from the field

Tested and running on CheckMK 2.2

Just some scripts that came in handy when needed - CheckMK is great, but lacking some details when it comes to monitoring Windows systems.
Mainly PowerShell as I personally consider PS the most powerful tool for Windows. Will maybe some scripts in VBS oder CMD, depending on my own needs and possibilites.
Feel free to use, fork, comment and make the whole thing run smooth and fast. ;-)
